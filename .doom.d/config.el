;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!


;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets.

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))

(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "PragmataPro" :size 16 :weight 'light)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "PragmataPro" :size 14))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
(setq doom-theme 'doom-one)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory "~/org/")

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
(setq display-line-numbers-type t)


;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys

(load! "sunra")

(use-package! corfu
  ;; Optional customizations

  (corfu-cycle t)                ;; Enable cycling for `corfu-next/previous'
  (corfu-auto t)                 ;; Enable auto completion
  ;; (corfu-separator ?\s)          ;; Orderless field separator
  ;; (corfu-quit-at-boundary nil)   ;; Never quit at completion boundary
  ;; (corfu-quit-no-match nil)      ;; Never quit, even if there is no match
  ;; (corfu-preview-current nil)    ;; Disable current candidate preview
  ;; (corfu-preselect-first nil)    ;; Disable candidate preselection
  ;; (corfu-on-exact-match nil)     ;; Configure handling of exact matches
  ;; (corfu-echo-documentation nil) ;; Disable documentation in the echo area
  ;; (corfu-scroll-margin 5)        ;; Use scroll margin

  ;; Enable Corfu only for certain modes.
  ;; :hook ((prog-mode . corfu-mode)
  ;;        (shell-mode . corfu-mode)
  ;;        (eshell-mode . corfu-mode))

  ;; Recommended: Enable Corfu globally.
  ;; This is recommended since Dabbrev can be used globally (M-/).
  ;; See also `corfu-excluded-modes'.

;; A few more useful configurations...
(use-package! emacs
  :init
  ;; TAB cycle if there are only few candidates
  (setq completion-cycle-threshold 3)

  ;; Emacs 28: Hide commands in M-x which do not apply to the current mode.
  ;; Corfu commands are hidden, since they are not supposed to be used via M-x.
  ;; (setq read-extended-command-predicate
  ;;       #'command-completion-default-include-p)

  ;; Enable indentation+completion using the TAB key.
  ;; `completion-at-point' is often bound to M-TAB.
  (setq tab-always-indent 'complete))


;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.
