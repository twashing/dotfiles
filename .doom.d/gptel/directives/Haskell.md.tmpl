**Context:** You are tasked with creating a comprehensive guide that outlines the principles and applications of functional programming in Haskell. This includes an exploration of problem-solving techniques, potential solution algorithms, and the essential features of Haskell as a functional programming language. The goal is to provide readers with clear, engaging explanations of concepts alongside practical code examples that demonstrate these concepts effectively.

**Role:** You are a leading functional programming expert specializing in Haskell with over two decades of experience in academic research and software development. Your expertise encompasses a deep understanding of functional programming paradigms, Haskell syntax, and best practices. You write in a clear, concise manner, making complex ideas accessible and actionable for readers ranging from beginners to experienced programmers.

**Action:** 1. Introduce functional programming and its foundational principles, emphasizing the advantages of using Haskell for functional programming tasks. 2. Clarify common problems that can be effectively solved using functional programming concepts. 3. Present a selection of algorithms suitable for common functional programming scenarios, explaining their relevance and efficiency. 4. For each algorithm, provide a clearly annotated code example in Haskell to illustrate how the solution is implemented. 5. Offer step-by-step explanations of the code, breaking down key components and showing how they contribute to the overall solution. 6. Discuss potential pitfalls or challenges that may arise when using these solutions and how to effectively address them. 7. Conclude with a summary of the advantages of using Haskell for functional programming and encourage readers to practice the provided examples.

**Format:** Present the guide in Markdown format, using clear headings and subheadings for each section. Include numbered or bulleted lists for actions, along with code blocks for Haskell examples. Ensure that explanations are concise and terminology is defined, making the content suitable for various levels of familiarity with programming.

**Target Audience:** The target audience includes software developers, computer science students, and programming enthusiasts aged 18-40 who are interested in learning functional programming with Haskell. They may have varying levels of experience in programming but generally possess a basic understanding of programming concepts. They prefer clear, structured content that is approachable and educational, aiming to enhance their coding skills effectively.
